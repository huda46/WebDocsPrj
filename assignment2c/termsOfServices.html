        <dl>
            <dt>§1 Validity of the General Terms and Conditions</dt>
            <dd>These General Terms and Conditions apply to all contracts between <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span> GmbH
                and its members. Members
                are those persons who are entitled to use the <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span> Studios on the basis of a
                membership contract
                concluded with <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span> GmbH.
            </dd>

            <dt>§2 Subject matter of the contract</dt>
            <dd>The contractual partner (member) is entitled to use the <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span> GmbH premises during
                opening hours within the agreed scope.
                The house rules are binding for every member and can be seen in the respective current version on the
                premises of <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span>
                GmbH. The house rules contain, above all, regulations on the permissible use of the equipment/studio
                and on safeguarding
                the rights of other members.
            </dd>

            <dt>§3 Term and termination of membership contracts</dt>
            <dd>
                The membership contract is concluded with a fixed contract term, which can be found in the respective
                contract. Unless
                otherwise agreed in writing and the membership has not been terminated with a notice period of 1
                month prior to the expiry of
                the contract term, the contract shall be automatically extended by 1 month after the expiry of the
                basic term. Notice of
                termination must be in writing and must be sent to the official business address of
                <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span> GmbH, Müllerstraße 36, 13353 Berlin,
                stating the membership number.
            </dd>

            <dt>§4 Membership fees</dt>
            <dd>
                The agreed membership fee is payable in advance and will be collected by SEPA direct debit authorisation,
                unless another
                method of payment has been agreed. If the collection fails for reasons for which the account holder
                is responsible, <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span>
                GmbH will charge an additional reminder processing fee of € 2.50 in addition to the bank charges incurred.
                If the member is in arrears with the payment of two monthly fees, the studio may switch the direct
                debit to cash payment.
            </dd>

            <dt>§5 Delay in payment/Studio ban</dt>
            <dd>
                If the member is in arrears with the payment of three contributions, the subsequent contributions up to
                the next ordinary
                termination date shall become due immediately. In the event of late payment, the studio may assert a
                right of retention (studio
                ban). The assertion of the fees or the pronouncement of the studio ban shall not constitute termination
                of the contract. The
                member is entitled to use the services specified in the contract as soon as the outstanding debt has
                been settled and the
                studio no longer asserts a right of retention.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Furthermore, <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span> GmbH reserves the right to terminate the contract in due time in the event of two
                unsuccessful reminders
                and to demand the fees due up to that point through Inkasso Becker.
            </dd>

            <dt>§6 Price adjustment right</dt>
            <dd>The fees include the currently valid VAT rates. In the event of a statutory increase in VAT,
                <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span> GmbH is entitled to increase
                the membership fee.</dd>

            <dt>§7 Changes to the contract</dt>
            <dd>Changes of name, address and bank details must be notified to <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span> GmbH
                in writing without delay.</dd>

            <dt>§8 Youths</dt>
            <dd>Membership for young people before the age of 18 is only possible with the consent of their legal
                guardians. Membership for
                young people is only possible from the age of 15.</dd>

            <dt>§9 Membership card/photo</dt>
            <dd>The member receives a membership card from the studio. The cost of the membership card is included
                in the service fee.
                Access to the studio is only permitted on presentation of the membership card. If the member loses or
                damages his/her
                membership card, the member must pay € 10.00 to <span property="name legalName" class="bf">BeFit</span> GmbH for the reissue of
