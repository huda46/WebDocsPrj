        <h1>Terms of Services</h1>
        <p>
            <br>
        General Terms and Conditions of BeFit GmbH<br>
        <br>
        §1 Validity of the General Terms and Conditions<br>
        These General Terms and Conditions apply to all contracts between BeFit GmbH and its members. Members are those
        persons who are entitled to use the BeFit Studios on the basis of a membership contract concluded with BeFit GmbH.<br>
        <br>
        §2 Subject matter of the contract<br>
        The contractual partner (member) is entitled to use the BeFit GmbH premises during opening hours within the agreed scope.
        The house rules are binding for every member and can be seen in the respective current version on the premises of BeFit
        GmbH. The house rules contain, above all, regulations on the permissible use of the equipment/studio and on safeguarding
        the rights of other members.<br>
        <br>
        §3 Term and termination of membership contracts<br>
        The membership contract is concluded with a fixed contract term, which can be found in the respective contract. Unless
        otherwise agreed in writing and the membership has not been terminated with a notice period of 1 month prior to the expiry of
        the contract term, the contract shall be automatically extended by 1 month after the expiry of the basic term. Notice of
        termination must be in writing and must be sent to the official business address of BeFit GmbH, Müllerstraße 36, 13353 Berlin,
        stating the membership number.<br>
        <br>
        §4 Membership fees<br>
        The agreed membership fee is payable in advance and will be collected by SEPA direct debit authorisation, unless another
        method of payment has been agreed. If the collection fails for reasons for which the account holder is responsible, BeFit
        GmbH will charge an additional reminder processing fee of € 2.50 in addition to the bank charges incurred.
        If the member is in arrears with the payment of two monthly fees, the studio may switch the direct debit to cash payment.<br>
        <br>
        §5 Delay in payment/Studio ban<br>
        If the member is in arrears with the payment of three contributions, the subsequent contributions up to the next ordinary
        termination date shall become due immediately. In the event of late payment, the studio may assert a right of retention (studio
        ban). The assertion of the fees or the pronouncement of the studio ban shall not constitute termination of the contract. The
        member is entitled to use the services specified in the contract as soon as the outstanding debt has been settled and the
        studio no longer asserts a right of retention.
        Furthermore, BeFit GmbH reserves the right to terminate the contract in due time in the event of two unsuccessful reminders
        and to demand the fees due up to that point through Inkasso Becker.<br>
        <br>
        §6 Price adjustment right<br>
        The fees include the currently valid VAT rates. In the event of a statutory increase in VAT, BeFit GmbH is entitled to increase
        the membership fee.<br>
        <br>
        §7 Changes to the contract<br>
        Changes of name, address and bank details must be notified to BeFit GmbH in writing without delay.<br>
        <br>
        §8 Youths<br>
        Membership for young people before the age of 18 is only possible with the consent of their legal guardians. Membership for
        young people is only possible from the age of 15.<br>
        <br>
        §9 Membership card/photo<br>
        The member receives a membership card from the studio. The cost of the membership card is included in the service fee.
        Access to the studio is only permitted on presentation of the membership card. If the member loses or damages his/her
        membership card, the member must pay € 10.00 to BeFit GmbH for the reissue of the membership card. Passing on the
